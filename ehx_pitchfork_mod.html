Pitchfork Eurorack Mod</b></font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Background</h1>
<p>EHX Pitchfork is a guitar effect that shifts the pitch of incoming
signal. Most likely, this is done by using a Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) to transform the signal into a frequency domain, move it by
desired amount, and transform back into time domain. This
modification is a interface board which allows using the effect with
standard Eurorack voltages and dimensions.</p>
<h1 class="western">Power Supply</h1>
<p>The first difference between the guitar effects and eurorack
applications is the supply voltage. The former uses 9V, the latter
uses +/-12V. However, the internal circuits of the Pitchfork are
mostly digital ICs (<a href="http://www.analog.com/ADSP-BF592?src=ADSP-BF592.pdf">ADSP-BF592</a>,
AK4552) running on 3.3V, requiring a voltage regulation from 9V.
Fortunately, the voltage regulator can handle up to 15V input voltage
(<a href="http://www.ti.com/product/tps62120?qgpn=tps62120">tps62120</a>).
I was slightly concerned about the ESD and reverse battery protection
circuits not withstanding 12V instead of 9V, but they did. Thus, the
EHX Pitchfork can be fully powered by the 12V eurorack rail connected
to its 9V supply input.</p>
<h1 class="western">Audio Signal Amplitude</h1>
<p>The second important consideration was the strength of the input
signal. The effect has been designed for guitar output signals, which
only reach 1V peak-to-peak  (Vpp) at the absolute maximum. On the
other hand, the Eurorack audio signal is usually 5Vpp, while other
Eurorack signals can climb up to 10V. To ensure compatibility with
any Eurorack signals, the interface board scales down the input
signal by 10, using a voltage divider (Figure 1). The input
resistance of the Pitchfork (turquoise block) is very high and does
not affect the divider ratio significantly.</p>

</span>Similarly, the output needs to be scaled back (Figure 2). As
can be seen, the gain is 1/divider_ratio so that the signal gets back

<br/>
<h1 class="western">
Controls
</h1>
<p>There is a couple of different knobs and switches to control the
effect: BLEND, SHIFT, LATCH and DIRECTION. Moreover, the is an EXP
input for expression pedal as well. 
</p>
<p>The function of the controls are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>BLEND – a knob that controls the ratio of the original and
	pitch-shifted signal</p>
	<li><p>SHIFT – a knob that selects the interval by which the audio
	is shifted</p>
	<li><p>LATCH – a button that toggles between momentary and always
	ON/OFF modes</p>
	<li><p>DIRECTION – a 3-position switch that selects the direction
	of pitch shifting: up, down or both</p>
	<li><p>EXP – the input works differently depends on the LATCH
	mode:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>momentary – sets the glide time from the original to the
		destination pitch</p>
		<li><p>ON/OFF - controls the interval by which the audio is
		shifted, from 0 to the interval set by the SHIFT knob</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>ENGAGE Footswitch – a button that turns effect ON or OFF
	depending on the LATCH mode</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>ON/OFF mode - toggles between ON and OFF on each press</p>
		<li><p>momentary – turns the effect ON only when the switch is
		pressed</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">EXP input – eurorack side</h2>
<p>Since Eurorack works on control voltages (CV), the aim of this
modification was to be able to control the parameters by voltage
signals instead of mechanical interface. Especially important is the
EXP input, since it allows for (almost) continuous variation of the
pitch, unlike the SHIFT knobs, which only selects from a common
intervals such as octaves.</p>
<p>The standard in eurorack is to use 1V/oct scaling for CVs that
control the pitch. Moreover, we want to exploit the whole range of
the effect, so the SHIFT knobs is assumed to be at 3 Octaves setting.
Since it is possible to shift up or down, that gives us +/-3 octave
shifting range. 
</p>
<p>Most sequencers and pitch CV signals work in the positive range of
voltages: they start at 0 for the lowest note and increase at 1V/oct.
However, LFO signals are usually centered around 0 and swing both
positive and negative. This offers two types of possible mapping
between input signal and the resulting pitch shift:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>0V means the lowest note and 6V is the highest note,
	corresponding to -3 octave shift and +3 octave shift, respectively.
	Thus, the original audio without pitch shifting occurs at 3V.</p>
	<li><p>-3V means the lowest and and 3V is the highest note,
	corresponding to -3 octave shift and +3 octave shift, respectively.
	The original audio without pitch shifting occurs at 0V.</p>
</ol>
<p>Because of this dilemma and to provide an option to tune any
offset, a potentiometer to set the ‘mid-point’, where no pitch
shifting occurs, has been added. The function between CV and shift
interval for both cases is shown in Figure 3.</p>

<h2 class="western">EXP input – Pitchfork side</h2>
<p>Now that there is a requirement what an input signal should be, it
needs to be transformed into an appropriate signal for the Pitchfork.
In the effect’s manual, is says the EXP input accepts either a 10k
potentiometer, or a control voltage between 0 and 5V. As mentioned
before, the effect changes the pitch depending on the EXP input: 0V
means no change, 5V means shift by the interval given by SHIFT knobs,
in this case 3 octaves. However, this is only in a direction given by
the DIRECTION switch, which needs to be changed in order to produce
the shift in other direction. In other words, for -3 octave shift,
the EXP in needs to be at maximum (5V) and the DIRECTION needs to be
set to DOWN. By reducing EXP input voltage, the pitch shift moves
towards 0 at EXP = 0V. Then the DIRECTION needs to be switched to UP
position and again EXP input needs to increase from 0V to 5V for
maximum 3 octave shift. This is visually displayed in Figure 4, where
x-axis is the desired pitch shift and y-axis is the required EXP
signal (orange) and DIRECTION (blue, 0 for down, 1 for up).</p>

</p>
<p>Putting together these two requirements for input CV voltage and
EXP voltage, it is possible to map them together. Figure 5 represents
the required EXP voltage (blue line y-axis) for given input CV
(x-axis) if 1V/oct scaling is desired and centered around 3V. Then,
the red line represents the position of the DIRECTION switch (0 for
down 1 for up). Also, the offset of the pitch-CV mapping determines
the ‘tipping’ point of this mapping function.</p>

<h2 class="western">
	Absolute value + gain + offset
</h2>
<p>As can be seen from Figure 5, the mapping function between input
CV and EXP is an absolute value function of a linear function with
slope 5/3. Thus: EXP(CV) = 5/3*(abs(x)). This can be easily
implemented by an absolute value circuit and a op-amp with gain of
5/3 (Figure 6). Moreover, the offset is added by a summing op-amp,
where one of the inputs is controlled by a potentiometer. The
variable offset range is between 0 and 4V. The gain stage is powered
by 5V taken from the EHX board,  to prevent over-voltage occurring at
EXP_ehx node. EXP connector provides 5V on its ring terminal.</p>

</span><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h2 class="western">DIRECTION Switch</h2>
<p>If the position of the switch could be controlled by logic
signals, it would be simple: a comparator with threshold of the
offset magnitude would decide whether the DIRECTION is up (1) or down
(0) depending on the EXP input signal.  However, the value of the
offset, and the signal that creates it are opposite, and would need
to be multiplied by -1. Because of this, the output of U2A op-amp is
used instead. This op-amp creates the absolute value by forcing
virtual GND on in inverting input for signals &lt;0. The diode in the
negative feedback needs a Vbe drop ~0.7V, so the output of the U2A
needs to be at that level. This would only apply for signals &lt;0,
while for signals &gt;0 the output will be 0 since its inverting
output &gt; non-inverting output. It is important to set the
threshold sufficiently low, as the diode voltage drop (and the U2A
output) can be as low as 0.4V. The comparator connection is explained
later.</p>
<p><img src="./images/ehx_mod/comp.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="100%" height="auto" border="0"/>
<br/>
</p>
<br/>
<p>On the EHX side, the switch works a bit differently than 2 logic
levels. It is a 3-position mechanical switch, which connects the
second (middle) terminal to the first terminal, no terminal, or the
third terminal depending on the position. The middle terminal is
connected and processed by the MCU. The resulting signals seen by the
MCU depending on the position are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>UP – logic low</p>
	<li><p>DUAL – logic high</p>
	<li><p>DOWN – square wave of 55Hz and 1.8Vpp</p>
</ol>
<p>The detailed schematic how this is implemented is shown below:</p>
<p><span id="Frame8" dir="ltr" style="float: left; width: 6.93in; border: none; padding: 0in; background: #ffffff"><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<img src="/images/ehx_mod/direction_switch.png" name="Image8" align="left" width="100%" height="auto">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Figure
	<span style="background: #c0c0c0">7</span>: 3-way switch selecting
	the direction of the pitch shift.</i></font></p>
</span><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The output of the comparator (Figure 7) is NMOS open-drain, so it
pulls the output to the ground for Vin- &gt; Vin+ and stays in high
impedance for Vin+ &gt; Vin-. Connecting the output to the middle
terminal of the switch allows pulling the node to GND (resulting in
setting the pitch shift direction to UP) or not interfering with the
node by being HI-Z. 
</p>
<p>To achieve setting the direction to DOWN position, it is needed to
present the 55Hz square wave to the middle terminal of the switch
(and MCU). It is possible to reuse the EHX generated wave by
connecting the first and the second (middle) terminals through a
resistor. Theoretically, a direct connection could work, but resistor
is used to limit the current when the middle terminal is pulled to
ground by the comparator to prevent any damage to the square wave
generation circuit. At the same time, the value should be
sufficiently low to prevent significant voltage-divider effect and
reduction of the signal seen by the MCU. A value of 3.3k Ohm seems to
work well. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the comparator should stay in HI-Z and let the square
wave signal go through unaffected when shifting downwards. This is
the case for EXP input signals lower than the offset, which are
positive at the input of the absolute value circuit, because of the
inversion in the summing op-amp. Conversely, the EXP input signals
higher than the offset are negative at the input of the absolute
value circuit. Thus, the polarity node (output of U2A) is 0 for EXP
input lower than offset and slightly positive for EXP input higher
than offset. Since comparator output is in HI-Z for Vin+ &gt; Vin-
and we want it to be HI-Z for polarity = 0 &lt; threshold = 0.16V,
then polarity needs to be connected to the inverting input and
threshold to the non inverting input.

<br/>

</p>
<p>This circuit pulls the terminal 2 to GND for polarity &lt; 0.16V,
resulting in UP shift direction. The circuit leaves terminal 2
unaffected for polarity &gt; 0.16V, resulting in DOWN shift
direction. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">ENGAGE switch</h2>
<p>The Pitchfork features a foot switch that engages the effect. It
has two modes: momentary and toggle. The foot switch is actually a
button connected to a MCU pin. It is normally open (HI-Z) and
connects the pin to GND upon pressing. On the interface board, this
is emulated by a NMOS transistor, with its input being controlled by
external gate-like CV. For logic HIGH input, the transistor pulls the
pin to GND, mimicking the button being pressed. For logic LOW, the
transistor is off and presents HI-Z to the pin. Furthermore, the
button was replicated on the interface board, so it can be controlled
by the user manually as well. Since the transistor is open-drain,
shorting of the output when the button is pressed is not an issue.

<h1 class="western">Connecting interface and EHX boards</h1>
<p>The interface board needs to be connected to the appropriate
points on the EHX board (Figure 10). The <b>+12V</b> power and <b>GND</b>
can be connected to the barrel power jack. The audio signals need to
be connected to the TIP terminals of the Input and Output connector
respectively. The EXP input control voltage (<b>EXP_ehx) </b>needs to
be connected to the TIP terminal of EXP connector. The output of the
comparator (<b>DUAL_ehx)</b> should be connected to the middle
terminal of the 3-way direction switch labeled as DUAL on the EHX
pcb. The <b>5V</b> should be connected to the RING terminal of the
EXP connector. The output of the switch control circuit <b>(SW_ehx)
</b><span style="font-weight: normal">sh</span>ould be connected to
the positive terminal of the footswitch. All the switches and
connectors except latch, were removed for better access. Furthermore,
jack connectors are switched, meaning they short two terminals when
unconnected, which is undesired.</p>
